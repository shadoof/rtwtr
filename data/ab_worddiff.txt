 Instead, it proposes to consider a tendency that underlies those problems: namely, the tendency 
-away from linear codes such as writing
+to deny or distrust the fundamental linearity of language (as perceptible phenomenon)
  and toward 
-two-dimensional
+multi-dimensional
  codes such as photographs, films,
-and
  TV, 
+screen-based graphic design in the service of social and socialized media, and, generally,
  a

  that 
+is dominated by visuality, by so-called “fine” as “visual” or “plastic” art even as and when this world of art embraces the conceptualism or “post-medium condition” which could, in principle if not in practice, be extended to the arts of language.

~
+All those gestures that we make with the prospect that others of us might read and understand them as entering and helping to constitute the world of language, all these gestures, regardless of their perceptible support media are <i>archi-writing</i> in Jacques Derrida’s sense.
~
+Iterable traces of actual language, all words are writing, as Derrida showed us.
~
+There is always and only the “logic of the supplement” with respect to the perceptible traces of language, typically and genetically supported by aurality; by cultural predominance, “historically” supported by calligraphic and now typographic visuality.

-Writing
+Instanced in integrated linguistic systems of inscription, the configuration of practices that we conventionally call writing
  is
-an
  important
-gesture,
  because it both articulates and produces that state of mind which is called “historical consciousness.”
~
 <ub>
~
 History began with the 
-invention
+authoritative emergence
  of 
-writing,
+writing in visuality,
  not for the banal reason often advanced that written texts permit us to reconstruct the past, but for the more pertinent reason that the world is not 
+necessarily
  perceived as a process, “historically,” unless one signifies it by successive 
-symbols,
+symbols that persist as writing.
~
+“Writing” in this historically implicated sense is ambiguous.
~
+The effects of a certain persistence in collective memory – such as those promoted
  by 
+oral cultures – are every bit as “historical” as the effects of literal or letteral
  writing.
~
+This follows, clearly and simply, from post-Derridean thought.
~
+Historical persistence in collective memory is an effect of what was archi-writing in aurality.
~
 </ub>
~
 <ub>
~
 The difference between 
+so-called
  prehistory and history is not that we have written documents that permit us to read the latter, but that during history there are literate 
-men
+persons
  who experience, understand, and evaluate the world as a 
-“becoming,”
+“becoming.”
~
 </ub>
~
 <ub>
~
-whereas in prehistory no such existential
+In what we prejudicially call “prehistory” this kind of existential, historical
  attitude 
-is possible.
+has a different extension and scale with respect to the sum of human culture.
~
 </ub>
~
 If the art of writing 
+(in either sense, post-Derridean or conventional)
  were to fall into oblivion, or if it were to become subservient to picture making (as in the “scriptwriting” 
-in
+of
  films), history in the 
-strict
+conventional (historically emergent)
  sense of that term would be 
-over.
+over, and perhaps it is.

 If one examines certain Mesopotamian tiles, one can see that the
-original
  purpose of 
+this early conventional
  writing was to facilitate the 
-deciphering
+reading
  of images.
~
 Those tiles contain images impressed upon them with cylindrical seals and “cuneiform” symbols scratched into them with a stylus.
~
 <ub>
~
 The “cuneiform” symbols form lines, and they obviously mean the image they accompany.
~
 They “explain,” “recount,” “tell” it.
~
+They provide it with an evocalization.
~
 </ub>
~
 They do so by unrolling the surface of the image into lines, by unwinding the tissue of the image into the threads of a text, 
+the vocabulary of an utterance,
  by rendering “explicit” what was “implicit” within the image.
~
 It may be shown through text 
-analysis
+analysis, through reading,
  that the
-original
  purpose of 
+such
  writing, namely, the transcoding of two-dimensional codes into a single dimension, is still there: 
-every
+Every
  text, 
+every utterance,
  even a very abstract one, 
+also
  means, in the last analysis, an image.
~
 <sb/>
~
 
~
 The translation from surface into line implies a radical change of 
+dimensionality with respect to the grasp of
  meaning.
~
 The eye that deciphers an image scans the surface, and it thus establishes reversible 
+and arbitrary spatial
  relations between the elements of the image.
~
 It may go back and forth while deciphering the image.
~
 This 
-reversibility
+spatiality
  of relations that prevails within the image characterizes the world for those who use images for the understanding of the world, who “imagine” it.
~
 For them, all the things in the world are related to each other in such a 
-reversible way,
+reversible, spatial equivalence,
  and 
-their
+the
  world is structured by “eternal return.”
~
 It is just as true to say that night follows day as that day follows night, that sowing follows reaping as that reaping follows sowing, that life follows death as that death follows life.
~
 The crowing of the cock calls the sun to rise just as much as the rising sun calls the cock to crow.
~
 In such a world, circular time orders all things, “assigns them their just place,” and if a thing is displaced it will be readjusted by time itself.
~
 Because to live is to displace things, life in such a world is a series of “unjust” acts that will be revenged in time.
~
 This demands that 
-man
+we
  propitiate the order of the world, the “gods” of which it is full.
~
 In sum: the “imagined” world is the world of myth, of magic, the 
-prehistorical
+ahistorical
  world.
~
 <sb/>
~
 
~
 The eye that 
-deciphers
+reads
  a 
-text
+text, the ear that reads to hear and understand a voice,
  follows its lines, and thus establishes 
-the univocal
+an evocalized
  relation
-of a chain
  between the elements of which the 
-text
+language
  is composed.
~
 Those who 
-use
+lend authority to inscribed
  texts 
+in order
  to understand the world, those who “conceive” it, mean a world with a linear structure.
~
 Everything in such a world follows from something, time flows irreversibly from the past toward the future, each instant lost is lost forever, and there is no repetition.
~
 Each day is different from every other day, each sowing has its own characteristics, if there is life after death it must be a new sort of life, and the links of the causal chain cannot be exchanged one for the other.
~
 In such a world, every human act is unique, and 
-man is
+we are
  responsible for it.
~
 The elements of such a world are, at least theoretically, distinct from each other like the beads on a string, and they can be counted.
~
 On the other hand, the string that orders the beads, the “univocal flow of time,” is what holds such a world together.
~
 In sum: the “conceived” world is the world of the religions, of salvation, of political commitment, of science, and of technology – the historical world.

 One may well ask why, six thousand years ago,
-the
  effort was 
-made
+expended
  to substitute the world of conception for the world of imagination, why 
+what we conventionally call
  writing 
-was invented.
+emerged in persistent authoritative gestures of inscription.
~
 One may ask this at present precisely because a “new civilization of images” seems to be dawning.
~
 The answer is, of course: 
-because, six thousand years ago, some
+because
  people 
+have always
  thought that some images needed 
-explaining.
+explaining and, six thousand years ago, they found new practices of language that were amenable to persistent exposition.
~
 Images are mediations between 
-man
+ourselves
  and 
-his world,
+our <i>world</i>,
  a 
-world that has become
+reality the unimaginably vast majority of which is
  inaccessible to 
-him immediately.
+human perception.
~
 They are tools 
+intended
  to overcome 
+this fundamental
  human alienation: they are meant to permit action in a world in which 
-man no longer lives
+we <i>cannot</i> live
  immediately but that 
-he faces.
+we face.
~
 Cave paintings are meant to permit hunting of ponies, cathedral windows to permit praying to God, road maps to permit motoring, and statistical projections 
+– now reconfigured by AI –
  to permit decision making.
~
 One must learn how to 
-decipher
+read
  those images, one must learn the conventions that give them their meaning, and one may commit mistakes.
~
 For instance: it would be a mistake to 
+read or
  decipher road maps as if they were cave paintings (magic for hunting tourists), or as if they were projections (proposals to build roads).
~
 The “imagination” that produces road maps is not the same as the “imagination” that produces cave paintings and projections.
~
 Explaining images with the help of 
-texts
+persistent linguistic inscription
  may therefore be useful.

 There is in images, as in all mediations, a curious inherent dialectic.

+that we can see, even those images that we can see and the world does not.
~
 </ub>
~
 It is against this idolatry of images, as a therapy against this double alienation, that 
-writing was invented.
~
-The early writers
+language cares for us.
~
+Some of those who first spoke to us
  in our 
-tradition

  – the prophets, for instance – 
-knew

  this by committing themselves against idols and idol making.
~
 And so did Plato when he announced his hatred of what we now call the “plastic arts.”

  to save

 Now, if we consider history to be the period 
-of writing,
+during
  which 
-implies that history is a development of prehistory,
+conventional writing performs
  a rendering explicit of what 
-was
+is
  implicit in 
-prehistorical myths, we find that it is
+myths of the imaginary, this continues to be, for us,
  a 
-slow
+problematic
  and painful, not to say tragic, process.
~
 For 
+the
  most 
-of its course,
+part,
  historical consciousness 
-was
+is
  the privilege of a small elite, while the vast majority 
-continued

  to lead

  magico-mythical existence.
~
 <ub>
~
-This was so because

  texts 
-were rare and expensive,
+of authority have always been scarce
  and 
-literacy
+expensive.
~
+The deep reading of books –
  the 
-privilege
+knowledge
  of 
+how and what to read – is restricted to
  a 
+privileged
  class of scribes and literati.

 The invention of printing

  rising bourgeoisie, but it was only during the industrial revolution and through the public primary school system that

  and historical consciousness can be said to have become common in the industrialized countries.

 But almost immediately a new kind of image, the photograph, was invented, which began to threaten the supremacy of 
+conventional
  writing, and 
+in the twentieth century
  it 
-now looks

  as if the days of historical, rational, conceptual thinking were numbered, and as if we were approaching a new type of magico-mythical age, a posthistorical image culture.

~
-The reason why rational,
+Rational,
  conceptual thinking (and acting) 
+has an intimate relationship with language as our shared realm for symbolic practice, yet rationality, which
  is 
+also in our world, may seem to us
  an exceptional form of existence,

  a brief interlude within

  ageless “eternal return” of

+But language,
  just like 
-images, is
+imaginary, may be
  torn by an internal dialectic, and

  this dialectic

  a more pernicious aspect in

  than it does even in image making.

-The purpose of writing is to

  constitute barriers between

  and the world.

 The vectors of meaning of such texts turn around and point at their authors, instead of pointing at 
-the world.
+our shared world, real or imaginary.
~
 This 
-inversion
+perversion
  of 
-writing
+language
  may be observed very early in the course of history, but during the nineteenth century it becomes obvious: scientific texts (which are the most characteristic form of 
+persistent
  writing, and therefore the “aim of history”) tend to become explicitly unimaginable (one reads them erroneously if one tries to imagine their meaning), and scientific research “discovers” the rules that order its own texts (mainly logic and mathematics) “behind” the phenomena it is explaining.
~
 Such unimaginable explanations that mirror the structure of literate thought are existentially devoid of meaning, and in such a situation texts begin to constitute a kind of paranoid library wall that triply alienates 
-man
+us
  from 
-his
+our
  world.
~
 <ub>
~
 It is against the threatening lunacy of formal rationalism, of a meaningless existence amid speculative, opaque explanations, that the rise of the new image culture must be seen.

 The essential difference between a TV program and a tapestry is not (as one might believe) that the one moves and talks while the other stands still and is mute, but that the TV program is the result of scientific theories (texts) and that it needs texts (for instance, telegrams) for it to function.

~
+We can imagine a future for practices of writing but we must keep in mind the circumstance that language is an evolved faculty and will not change significantly until evolution enables it to do so – beyond the scope of our imagination – because imagination, myth and magic, our imaginary and symbolic existences are similarly evolved.
~
+All of what we call history can only ever be something that we imagine and express as language within the scope of our evolved faculties.

+We ourselves have not changed; our shared practices are reconfigured within this scope with respect to technics that are, indeed, associated with the symbolic, if not also the real.

 From the point of view of the texts that

  the box is the “fullness of time,” because it devours linear

+consumes and renders time as persuasive images that consume our attention.
~
 From the point of view of the images that come out of the box, this will be a situation in which history becomes a 
+mere
  pretext for

 It is not important for the understanding of

  of writing to try to whiten the black box, to try to understand how it works.
~
 The attempt to “demythify” the 
+computational
  transcoding apparatus
-of the future
  is, of course, one of the most important challenges of “forecasting and planning 
+now and
  for the future.”
~
 But it is not indispensable where 
+practices of
  writing

  the problem.
~
 One may disregard the wheels and screws that constitute the apparatus (the countless “media,” “programmers,” and other human and quasi-human operators who compose it), and concentrate upon the images as they come out of the box left black, if one wants to see what it 
-will mean

  to be a “writer”

  future.
~
 In other words, it is not necessary to analyze the whole hopelessly complex system that stands behind a TV program 
+or social media platform
  if one wants to understand

  crisis of rational thinking and acting.

 It is sufficient to analyze

 Therefore, during history, imagination was the source of reason: the stronger the imagination, the greater the challenge of critical reason, and rich images permit more powerful linear explanations.

 One may sum this up as follows: when it became obvious that reason might be a kind of paranoia, the intellectuals stopped being iconoclastic and became idolatrous, and present TV programs

 This is why the battle cry “L’imagination au pouvoir!” that shook so many intellectuals out of their dogmatic slumber in May ’68 has such a dubious ring to it.
~
 No doubt, rebellion against paranoid reason, against meaningless explanations, is necessary and healthy.
~
 But intellectuals are 
-writers.
+language makers.
~
 They are committed to clear and distinct concepts, to reason.
~
 They are the historical consciousness of their society.
~
 If they adhere to the claim that imagination should take over, the dignity of man as a free actor, which means “history,” will be over.

~
 It may be asked, however, what 
-else writers
+language artists
  can do in the immediate future but serve imagination.
~
 If all the texts are
-going to be
  devoured by the gigantic transcoder to become images, how can this trend be resisted?
~
 Is it not so that if a text deliberately resists the trend, it becomes even better fodder for the 
+universal computational
  transcoding apparatus?
~
 Actions committed to history and against the apparatus, like monks burning themselves to death or students being killed in riots, are even better pretexts for TV programs 
+and social media
  than are deliberate scripts made by TV 
-programmers.
~
-It may look as if
+programmers or bloggers.
~
+The universal trend in
  the 
-trend,
+developed world –
  in which 
+practices of language and of digitalized
  writing 
-is
+in particular are
  becoming subservient to image making, planning to irrationality, and reason to 
-magic,
+magic –
  is 
-increasingly automatic
+now literally automatic: computed, <i>automated</i>
  and autonomous of 
+both institutional and
  individual decisions.

 <sb/>

~
 This would be a perniciously wrong interpretation of 
-the present
+any ostensible
  crisis of 
-writing.
~
-The purpose of writing is to explain
+language.
~
+Language makes and works together with
  images, and the task of 
-reason
+reason, or symbolic thought as language,
  is to criticize imagination.

~
 This is doubly true in 
-the present

  crisis.

~
-At present,
+Language must now make and work with both the techno-images of Flusser’s apparatuses and with

 Of course, this implies a sort of qualitative jump onto a new level of meaning on the part of reason.

-It will mean, in the future,
+Now, it must mean
  to render opaque 
-techno-images
+techno- and computational images
  transparent for the texts they are hiding.

 In other words, reason, in the past, meant analysis of myths, and in the future it will mean de-ideologization.

 Reason will still be iconoclastic, but on a new 
-level.

 It is perfectly possible that the general trend toward
